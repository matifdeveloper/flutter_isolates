# Flutter Isolates

### Understanding Isolates in Flutter

Isolates in Flutter are independent workers that run concurrently with the main program. They enable executing tasks in parallel, thus preventing the main thread from becoming blocked. This is particularly useful for handling complex computations, network operations, and I/O-bound tasks without affecting the UI responsiveness.

### How Isolates Improve Performance

By offloading resource-intensive operations to isolates, Flutter apps can maintain a smooth user experience even when dealing with heavy computational tasks. For instance, tasks like image processing, data parsing, or database operations can be delegated to isolates, leaving the main thread free to handle UI updates promptly.
